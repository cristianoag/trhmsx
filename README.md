# Introduction

MSX computers hold a significant place in computing history, and their legacy continues to be celebrated through innovative approaches like FPGA synthesis. Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) provide a unique platform for recreating the MSX architecture, offering a flexible and efficient way to re-create the hardware. 

This synthesis enables enthusiasts to experience the charm of MSX systems without relying on original, often scarce, hardware components. FPGA-based MSX simulations can faithfully replicate the distinctive features of these iconic computers, including the Z80 processor, graphics capabilities, and sound architecture. 

This modern approach not only preserves the nostalgia associated with MSX but also opens up possibilities for enhancements and customizations. FPGA synthesis ensures that the MSX spirit endures, catering to both seasoned aficionados and new generations eager to explore the roots of personal computing.

# TRHMSX - The Simple FPGA MSX2+ clone

This FPGA-based MSX2+ hardware represents a straightforward implementation, drawing inspiration from the original 1chipMSX circuit but featuring several enhancements and a new PCB design for improved functionality. Despite its advanced capabilities, the primary focus during development was on maintaining a low-cost solution.

The core of this system is the Cyclone II FPGA, accompanied by a few additional components. The PCB is a 4-layer board measuring 12x15 cm. The FPGA is a 240-pin package, which is challenging to solder manually. Instead, using an SMT oven or a hot air station is advised for optimal results. For those opting for a hot air station, employing a stencil to apply solder paste is highly recommended, significantly streamlining the assembly process.

## Open Source

This project stands as a testament to the spirit of open source collaboration. Over the years, the original 1chipMSX circuit has inspired numerous clones, some even commercially implemented, each potentially harboring unique modifications. Regrettably, many of these adaptations were never shared with the broader community. In response, this project emerges as a fresh implementation of the original circuit, introducing enhancements and a redesigned PCB.

What sets this initiative apart is its commitment to transparency. From the project's inception, the goal was clear: to share all design files openly. This includes not only the schematics and PCB layout but also the Bill of Materials (BOM) and any other essential documentation for recreating the project.

In stark contrast to its predecessors, this project was conceived with a dedication to community collaboration. If you choose to utilize these resources to construct your own MSX2+ clone or find ways to enhance it, I encourage you to contribute back to the community. Share your experiences, document any improvements you make, and actively participate in the collective evolution of this open source endeavor.

Let this project serve as a reminder of the **reciprocal nature of open source**. By using and benefiting from open source projects, it becomes a responsibility to give back, ensuring the continued growth and enrichment of the shared knowledge pool within the community.
